# GoogleDriveTests
Please redirect to the GoogleDriveDownloadCode Folder and you can run the gradle directly from the Commannd prompt by using "gradle run" command
(you must need to have gradle in your system)
Then open test-maven file
Inside main you will find a DownloadFileTests file. This I have created for test cases to test the google drive download scenario.
Lastly, in the last file name "test_Scenarios", there are manual possible scenarios for google drive download files(This Excel file contains few other scenarios as well other than Download)
